# 🍵 Modeling Tea Bag Diffusion Kinetics – CHE213 Final Project

This project investigates mass transfer from a tea bag into water using a low-cost photocolorimetric setup and Fickian diffusion modeling. Conducted as part of **CHE213: Mass Transfer** at IIT Kanpur.

**Mentor:** Prof. Himanshu Sharma

## 🎯 Objective

To experimentally monitor and model the rate of solute diffusion from tea leaves into hot water using Crank’s solution to Fick’s second law for spherical systems.

---

## ⚙️ Methodology

- **Experiment**: Tea bags immersed in 150 mL water at 53°C, 63°C, and 73°C
- **Measurements**: Absorbance recorded every 10 seconds for 350 seconds using a photocolorimeter
- **Modeling**: MATLAB used to fit Crank’s model and extract diffusivity

---

## 📊 Results

- Higher water temperatures led to faster extraction and greater diffusivity
- Curve fits showed good agreement (R² > 0.82)

---

## 💡 Future Improvements

- Use camera-based vision in place of colorimeter
- Build predictive brewing model based on time-temperature-flavor profile
- Integrate with smart kettles for real-time tea strength monitoring
